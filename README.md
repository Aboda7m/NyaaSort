# NyaaSort

NyaaSort is a Python script for dealing with people who are to lazy to sort their anime.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python > 3.6 since I did not test it on anything else.

Just drag the NyaaSort.py file into the directory you want it to sort. 

The script will ask If you want to enable logging or not and figures out the rest itself.

It will automatically add itself to boot-up, if somebody wants me to make that an option instead of a default let me know. 


## Usage

It will run on boot-up, but you can make it manually run by either double clicking or running it from a terminal. 

Before:

After: 

![After image](./readme/after.png?raw=true "Title")
## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate, I was not able to upload the anime I used to test the script for obvious reasons, Just add your own to

integration\fixtures
```

Please don't push to master. I might still approve it if it's a good contribution, but you will make me  cry.
